Features
Add User Profile: Users can input a name, age, and email to add a new user profile. The data is stored in the browser's local storage.

Edit User Profile: Users can edit existing user profiles by clicking the "edit" button on each profile. The edited information is updated in real-time and persisted in local storage.
